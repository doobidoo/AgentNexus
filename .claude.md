# Project Nexus - Claude AI Development Guide

## Overview

Project Nexus is a TypeScript-based AI agent framework with modular systems for memory, planning, action execution, and tool integration. This file serves as a root-level guide for Claude AI to assist with development tasks.

### Custom Slash Commands

Access custom commands through the slash command menu:
- `/project:fix-issue <issue-number>` - Analyze and fix a GitHub issue
- `/project:implement-feature <feature-description>` - Implement a new feature

## Using Claude for Development

### Command System

Use the following commands to access project information:
- `nexus-status`: Review overall project status
- `nexus-standards [component]`: Access component standards
- `nexus-memory-system`, `nexus-planning`, etc.: Focus on specific components

### Session Workflow

1. Begin with repository exploration and task selection
2. Break down complex tasks into steps
3. Follow TypeScript and component-specific standards
4. Document all implementation decisions
5. End sessions with proper summaries and task updates

### Best Practices for Claude Prompts

1. Reference specific files and directories
2. Mention standards when requesting implementation help
3. Break complex tasks into manageable steps
4. Reference existing patterns in the codebase
5. Provide visual elements when discussing UI components

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Visual Elements

When working with UI components or diagrams:
- Provide screenshots or design mocks when available
- Request visual feedback on implementations
- Use the visual feedback loop process described in `/docs/claude/visual-elements.claude.md`

### GitHub Integration

For GitHub-related tasks:
- Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for repository operations
- Follow commit message conventions (see `/docs/claude/github-integration.claude.md`)
- Request PR reviews and issue triage assistance

### Multi-Claude Workflows

For complex development tasks:
- Consider using multiple Claude instances with specialized roles
- Set up parallel workflows as described in `/docs/claude/multi-claude-workflows.claude.md`
- Use file-based coordination mechanisms

### Headless Mode Automation

For CI/CD and automated tasks:
- Leverage headless mode patterns from `/docs/claude/headless-mode.claude.md`
- Consider batch processing for repetitive tasks
- Integrate with GitHub Actions or Jenkins pipelines

## Example Prompts

For general project assistance:
```
nexus-status

I'm working on improving the memory system's retrieval capabilities. 
Can you help me understand the current implementation and suggest
improvements based on the memory system standards?
```

For specific implementation help:
```
nexus-standards memory

I need to implement a new memory consolidation feature that will 
periodically review and merge similar memories. Please help me design
this following the memory system architecture in 
/src/core/memory/index.ts.
```

For code review:
```
I've implemented a new planning strategy in 
/src/core/planning/subgoal.ts. Can you review this implementation
against the planning system standards and suggest improvements?
```

For visual element implementation:
```
Here's a design mock for a new agent control panel [image].
Please implement this as a React component using Tailwind CSS
following our component standards.
```

## Getting Started

1. Explore the project structure using directory listing tools
2. Review the documentation in `/docs/`
3. Check component standards for areas of interest
4. Use the command system to navigate the project architecture

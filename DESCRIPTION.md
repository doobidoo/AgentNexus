# Project Nexus Repository Description (Work in Progress)

## Short Description (< 250 characters)
[WIP] A TypeScript-based autonomous agent framework with modular systems for memory, planning, and tool integration. Currently under active development - not yet ready for production use.

## Extended Description
**⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️**

Project Nexus is a modular framework for building sophisticated autonomous agents with cognitive capabilities, currently in early development. Built with TypeScript, it aims to provide integrated systems for memory persistence, strategic planning, action execution, and tool integration.

### Current Development Status
- 🚧 **Alpha Stage**: Core architecture and interfaces defined
- 🚧 **Experimental**: APIs may change significantly
- 🚧 **Seeking Contributors**: Feedback and contributions welcome

### Key Features (In Development)
- **Memory System**: Vector-based storage with semantic search capabilities
- **Planning System**: Multi-strategy planning with reflection and self-critique
- **Action System**: Structured execution of tools with feedback collection
- **Tool System**: Extensible framework for agent capabilities
- **Web Automation**: Browser integration using Playwright

Designed for researchers and developers working on agentic AI, Project Nexus offers a flexible architecture that can be customized for various applications while maintaining core cognitive capabilities.

## Development Roadmap
- [x] Core system architecture design
- [x] Basic interface definitions
- [ ] Memory system implementation
- [ ] Planning system implementation
- [ ] Action and tool system implementation
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] First alpha release

We welcome feedback, ideas, and contributions as we work toward a stable release.

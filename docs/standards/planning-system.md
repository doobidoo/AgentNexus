## Implementation Guidelines

1. Implement clear interfaces between planning components
2. Use strongly typed representations for plans and goals
3. Create visualization tools for plan inspection
4. Develop comprehensive unit tests for planning algorithms
5. Implement performance benchmarks for planning operations
6. Support plan serialization for persistence
7. Provide debug tools for plan analysis
8. Ensure thread safety for concurrent planning operations

## Code Examples

```typescript
// Define a planning domain
const domain = new PlanningDomain({
  name: "AgentNexus",
  actions: [
    new Action({
      name: "FetchData",
      parameters: ["source: DataSource", "query: Query"],
      preconditions: "source.isAvailable && query.isValid",
      effects: "agent.hasData(query.result)",
      cost: 1
    }),
    // Additional actions...
  ]
});

// Create a planning problem
const problem = new PlanningProblem({
  domain: domain,
  initialState: "agent.hasCredentials && !agent.hasData",
  goalState: "agent.hasData && agent.hasProcessedData"
});

// Generate a plan
const plan = planningManager.generatePlan(problem);

// Execute the plan
const executionResult = await planExecutor.execute(plan);

// Adapt the plan if needed
if (!executionResult.success) {
  const adaptedPlan = planningManager.adaptPlan(plan, executionResult.currentState);
  await planExecutor.execute(adaptedPlan);
}
```

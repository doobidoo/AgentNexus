# Memory System Standards

## Memory System Architecture

- **MemoryManager (orchestration)**
  - Central controller for all memory operations
  - Coordinates between storage, retrieval, and indexing
  - Handles memory lifecycle management
  - Implements caching strategies

- **MemoryStore (storage)**
  - Persistent storage interface
  - Handles serialization/deserialization
  - Implements transactional operations
  - Manages data consistency

- **MemoryRetrieval (retrieval)**
  - Implements search algorithms
  - Handles query parsing and execution
  - Supports filtering and sorting
  - Implements relevance scoring

- **MemoryIndex (indexing)**
  - Maintains optimized access structures
  - Implements B-tree or similar indexing
  - Handles reindexing operations
  - Supports compound and multi-field indexes

## Memory Types

- **Episodic (experience-based)**
  - Stores temporal sequences of events
  - Includes context and environmental details
  - Maintains causal relationships
  - Supports "remember when" queries

- **Semantic (factual knowledge)**
  - Stores conceptual information and facts
  - Organized by ontological relationships
  - Supports inference and reasoning
  - Implements fact verification

- **Procedural (how-to knowledge)**
  - Stores action sequences and methods
  - Includes execution conditions and constraints
  - Supports parameterization
  - Enables skill transfer and adaptation

- **Working (current context)**
  - Maintains active task information
  - Implements priority-based attention mechanisms
  - Handles context switching
  - Supports temporary associations

- **Associative (relationship-based)**
  - Implements graph-based memory structures
  - Supports spreading activation
  - Enables analogical reasoning
  - Maintains strength of associations

## Vector Database Integration

- **Embedding Generation Standards**
  - Use consistent embedding models across the system

  - Implement embedding caching for frequent operations
  - Standardize normalization approaches

- **Dimensional Reduction Strategies**
  - Use PCA for memory visualization
  - Implement UMAP for clustering visualization

  - Standardize input processing pipelines
  - Implement content validation
  - Support batch encoding operations
  - Handle multimodal content consistency

- **Storage (organization and persistence)**
  - Implement efficient serialization formats

  - Define backup and recovery procedures

- **Retrieval (access and ranking)**
  - Support exact and semantic search modes
  - Implement hybrid retrieval algorithms
  - Standardize relevance scoring
  - Support pagination and streaming for large results

- **Consolidation (refinement and summarization)**
  - Schedule periodic memory review
  - Implement duplicate detection and merging
  - Support hierarchical summarization
  - Define memory reinforcement mechanisms

- **Forgetting (pruning and archiving)**
  - Implement importance-based retention
  - Support explicit and implicit forgetting
  - Define archiving policies
  - Implement graceful degradation of memory details

## Memory Usage Patterns

- **Relevance-based Retrieval**
  - Use semantic similarity for initial retrieval
  - Apply contextual reranking
  - Implement hybrid exact/semantic approaches
  - Support temporal and spatial constraints

- **Temporal Sequence Reconstruction**
  - Store and retrieve event chains
  - Maintain causality relationships
  - Support gap filling in sequences
  - Implement uncertainty handling for reconstruction

- **Counterfactual Reasoning Support**
  - Store alternative branches in decision trees
  - Support hypothetical reasoning
  - Implement difference analysis
  - Maintain counterfactual worlds separately

- **Analogical Mapping**
  - Identify structural similarities between domains
  - Support transfer learning between contexts
  - Implement relation-preserving mappings
  - Score and rank analogical matches

- **Causal Reasoning**
  - Maintain explicit causal graphs
  - Support interventional queries
  - Implement counterfactual estimation
  - Distinguish correlation from causation

## MCP Functions for Memory Management

```typescript
// Storing memory with tags
store_memory({
  content: "Implementation details: The memory indexing system uses a B-tree structure with order 5...",
  metadata: {
    tags: "memory-system,indexing,b-tree,implementation",
    type: "technical"
  }
});

// Retrieving memories by semantic search
retrieve_memory({
  query: "B-tree implementation details",
  n_results: 5
});

// Time-based memory retrieval
recall_memory({
  query: "what did we work on last session",
  n_results: 3
});

// Tag-based memory search
search_by_tag({
  tags: ["memory-system", "indexing"]
});

// Removing obsolete memories
delete_memory({
  content_hash: "a1b2c3d4..."
});

// Cleaning up memory categories
delete_by_tag({
  tag: "temporary"
});
```

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Prioritize type safety throughout the memory system
2. Implement comprehensive error handling for all operations
3. Document memory schemas and access patterns
4. Develop unit tests for all memory operations
5. Benchmark performance for large memory stores
6. Establish clear versioning for memory structures
7. Implement secure access controls for sensitive memories
8. Create visualization tools for memory exploration

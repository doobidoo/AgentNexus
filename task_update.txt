## Task Update: Fixed Subgoal Type Errors

### Changes Made:
1. Fixed type error in `execution.ts` where Property 'id' does not exist on type 'Subgoal'
2. Updated the `Plan` interface in `planning/index.ts` to properly type subgoals as `SubgoalData[]`
3. Added imports for `SubgoalData` in the necessary files
4. Fixed the method parameter types in `executeSubgoal` and `adaptToError` to use `SubgoalData`

### Next Steps:
1. Continue testing the execution system with proper types
2. Implement more advanced execution features 
3. Add better error handling and recovery strategies

The fixes maintain the existing functionality while properly applying TypeScript's type system to ensure type safety throughout the codebase.

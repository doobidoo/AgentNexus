# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement ImageAnalysis and KnowledgeGraph Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the ImageAnalysis tool for visual content understanding and KnowledgeGraph for relation-based knowledge representation.
# Details:
Create ImageAnalysis tool with integration to computer vision models for object detection, classification, and image understanding. Implement KnowledgeGraph tool with graph database integration for storing and querying relationship data. Add methods for graph traversal, path finding, and relationship discovery. Ensure both tools follow the standardized interface. Implement caching and optimization for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test ImageAnalysis with various image types and visual scenarios. Verify KnowledgeGraph correctly stores and retrieves relationship data. Test complex graph queries and traversals. Measure performance with large graphs and image datasets.

# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Tool Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the standardized tool interface and management system that enables dynamic tool selection based on task requirements.
# Details:
Design and implement a standardized tool interface that all tools must implement. Create the tool registry system for registering and discovering available tools. Implement the tool selection algorithm that chooses appropriate tools based on task context. Add configuration options for tool behavior. Develop error handling and retry mechanisms for tool execution. Include logging for tool usage and performance.

# Test Strategy:
Verify tool registration and discovery works correctly. Test tool selection algorithm with various scenarios. Ensure error handling properly manages tool failures. Measure performance overhead of tool management system.

# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Feedback Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the feedback system with performance evaluation metrics, failure analysis framework, and continuous improvement capabilities.
# Details:
Create feedback collection system that gathers execution results and performance data. Implement performance evaluation metrics for various aspects of agent behavior. Develop failure analysis framework to identify and categorize errors. Add learning mechanisms for continuous improvement through experience. Create feedback visualization and reporting. Implement feedback integration with planning and memory systems.

# Test Strategy:
Test feedback collection with various execution scenarios. Verify metrics accurately reflect performance. Test failure analysis with intentionally problematic executions. Evaluate improvement over time with repeated similar tasks.

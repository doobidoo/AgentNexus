# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Action System Execution Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the execution engine for implementing plans with monitoring capabilities and handling environmental uncertainties.
# Details:
Create execution engine that can interpret and execute plans from the planning system. Implement monitoring capabilities to track progress and detect deviations. Add mechanisms for handling environmental uncertainties and unexpected outcomes. Develop real-time adjustment capabilities for changing conditions. Implement execution logging and state tracking. Create interfaces between execution engine and tool management system.

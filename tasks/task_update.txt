# Task Update - Short-Term Memory System TypeScript Fix

Date: April 20, 2025

## Completed Tasks
- Fixed TypeScript ES5 compatibility issue in ShortTermMemory implementation
- Added "downlevelIteration": true to tsconfig.json 
- Replaced Object.entries() with ES5-compatible iteration pattern
- Restored the original for...of loop with Map.entries() for better readability

## Technical Details
The build error was occurring because the code was using ES6+ iteration features (specifically Map.entries() in a for...of loop) but the TypeScript configuration was targeting ES5 without downlevelIteration support. 

Instead of completely rewriting the code to avoid modern iteration patterns, we added the "downlevelIteration" flag to tsconfig.json, which allows TypeScript to properly transpile these iteration patterns to ES5-compatible code.

We also replaced Object.entries() usage with a traditional for...in loop plus Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty checks for better ES5 compatibility in the metadata handling code.

- /Users/hkr/Documents/GitHub/AgentNexus/tsconfig.json

## Next Steps
- Consider upgrading the TypeScript target to ES2015 or higher in the future for better code readability and reduced transpilation overhead
- Complete implementation of the LongTermMemory class with similar ES5 compatibility considerations
- Proceed with integrating the ShortTermMemory with LLM services for better conversation summarization

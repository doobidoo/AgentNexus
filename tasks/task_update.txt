# Project Nexus Task Updates

Last Updated: April 20, 2025

## Recently Completed Tasks

### Fix Type Error in CompletionOptions Interface (Task ID: 6)
- Fixed the type error in agent.ts where 'model' property was incorrectly used in CompletionOptions interface
- Modified agent.ts to use 'responseFormat: { model: this.modelName }' instead of 'model: this.modelName'
- Enhanced the CompletionOptions interface in base.ts to have a more specific definition for responseFormat
- Improved how each model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic) handles the responseFormat parameter for better consistency
- Updated logging in providers to show which model is being used

## In Progress Tasks

None currently in progress.

## Next Priority Tasks

1. Implement Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms for Tool Execution (Task ID: 4, Subtask ID: 6)
2. Implement Logging and Monitoring System for Tools (Task ID: 4, Subtask ID: 7)
3. Implement VectorSearch and TextGeneration Tools (Task ID: 5)

## Project Status Summary

The project is progressing well with the core architecture in place. The memory system and tool management system are completed. The bug with the CompletionOptions interface has been fixed, ensuring type safety in the model provider implementations.

Next steps are to complete the remaining tool management features (error handling, retry mechanisms, and logging) and then implement the first two core tools: VectorSearch and TextGeneration.

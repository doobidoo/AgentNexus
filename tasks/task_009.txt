# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Planning System Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the cognitive planning system with reflection, self-critics, chain of thoughts, and subgoal decomposition capabilities.
# Details:
Create planning system architecture with components for goal analysis, strategy formulation, and plan generation. Implement reflection mechanisms for self-assessment of reasoning processes. Add self-critics for error identification and correction. Develop chain of thought processes for transparent reasoning. Implement subgoal decomposition for breaking complex problems into manageable tasks. Create plan representation format and storage.

# Test Strategy:
Test planning system with various goal complexities. Verify subgoal decomposition creates appropriate subtasks. Evaluate reflection and self-criticism with intentionally flawed plans. Measure planning efficiency and quality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Goal Analysis and Decomposition Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundation module that analyzes high-level goals and decomposes them into manageable subgoals using hierarchical structures
### Details:
Implement a GoalAnalyzer class that takes a high-level goal as input and outputs a structured representation of subgoals. Create data structures for goal representation including goal properties, success criteria, and dependencies between subgoals. Develop algorithms for identifying logical subgoals based on task complexity and dependencies. Include methods for validating goal decomposition completeness. Test with various goal complexities to ensure proper decomposition. This module should expose clear interfaces for the planning system to interact with decomposed goals.

## 2. Develop Strategy Formulation Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build the component responsible for generating strategic approaches to achieve goals based on the decomposed subgoals
### Details:
Create a StrategyGenerator class that consumes decomposed goals from the Goal Analysis module and produces strategic approaches. Implement multiple strategy generation algorithms including template-based, precedent-based, and first-principles reasoning. Design a strategy evaluation mechanism to rank potential approaches based on feasibility, resource requirements, and likelihood of success. Include interfaces for strategy representation, comparison, and selection. Develop unit tests for strategy generation with different goal types. Ensure the component can explain the rationale behind generated strategies to support transparency.

## 3. Implement Chain of Thought and Reasoning Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Create the reasoning engine that implements transparent chain of thought processes for plan generation and decision making
### Details:
Develop a ReasoningEngine class that implements step-by-step logical reasoning processes. Create data structures to represent and store reasoning chains with intermediate steps, assumptions, and conclusions. Implement methods to generate, validate, and traverse reasoning chains. Design interfaces to expose reasoning processes for inspection and explanation. Build mechanisms to identify logical fallacies or gaps in reasoning chains. Integrate with the Strategy Formulation component to apply reasoning to strategy selection. Test with complex reasoning scenarios requiring multiple logical steps. Include serialization methods for storing and retrieving reasoning chains.

## 4. Build Self-Criticism and Reflection System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement mechanisms for the planning system to critically evaluate its own outputs and reasoning processes
### Details:
Create a ReflectionSystem class with capabilities to analyze and critique reasoning chains, strategies, and plans. Implement multiple critique perspectives (feasibility, completeness, efficiency, etc.) that can be applied to any planning output. Develop metrics for self-evaluation of plan quality. Build mechanisms to identify potential failure points in plans. Create interfaces for recording reflections and critiques alongside plans. Implement suggestion generation for plan improvements based on identified weaknesses. Test with deliberately flawed plans to ensure critique effectiveness. Design the system to integrate reflection outputs back into the planning process for iterative improvement.

## 5. Develop Plan Representation and Integration Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create the final plan representation format and integration layer that connects all planning components into a cohesive system
### Details:
Design and implement comprehensive Plan data structures that incorporate subgoals, strategies, reasoning chains, and reflections. Create a PlanningSystem orchestrator class that coordinates the workflow between all components. Implement plan serialization and storage mechanisms for persistence. Develop interfaces for external systems to request plans, monitor execution, and provide feedback. Build plan visualization capabilities for human review. Create comprehensive integration tests that exercise the full planning pipeline. Implement hooks for memory system integration to store and retrieve past plans. Design interfaces for tool management to allow plans to incorporate tool usage. Include documentation generation capabilities to explain plans in human-readable format.

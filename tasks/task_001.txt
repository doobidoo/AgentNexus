# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Base Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with the modular architecture structure for Agent Nexus, including component separation for memory, tools, planning, and action systems.
# Details:
Create a new repository with appropriate licensing. Set up the project structure with separate modules for each core component (Memory, Tools, Planning, Action). Implement the event-driven communication system between components. Create configuration loading system that supports YAML files. Set up Docker configuration for containerization. Initialize documentation structure.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure matches architectural requirements. Ensure basic event communication between components works. Test configuration loading with sample YAML files.

5. Add development dependencies (pytest, black, isort, mypy, etc.)
6. Create tests/ directory with pytest configuration
7. Setup pre-commit hooks for code quality
8. Test by running `poetry install` and verifying the environment is created correctly

## 3. Implement Core Component Directory Structure and Interfaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create the modular directory structure for all core components with proper __init__.py files and define base interfaces for each component.
### Details:
1. Create directories for each core component:
   - src/agent_nexus/memory/
   - src/agent_nexus/tools/
   - src/agent_nexus/planning/
   - src/agent_nexus/action/
   - src/agent_nexus/core/
2. Add __init__.py files to each directory to make them proper packages
3. Create base interface classes for each component in their respective directories:
   - memory/base.py with BaseMemory interface
   - tools/base.py with BaseTool interface
   - planning/base.py with BasePlanner interface
   - action/base.py with BaseAction interface
4. Define core exceptions in core/exceptions.py
5. Test by importing each base interface in a test file

## 4. Develop Configuration System with YAML Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Implement a configuration loading and validation system that supports YAML files with schema validation using Pydantic.
### Details:
1. Create src/agent_nexus/core/config.py module
2. Define ConfigLoader class that loads YAML files
3. Create Pydantic models for configuration validation in core/schemas.py
4. Implement configuration merging logic for overriding defaults
5. Add support for environment variable substitution in config files
6. Create default configuration files in config/ directory
7. Write unit tests for configuration loading and validation
8. Test by loading sample configurations and validating against schemas

## 5. Implement Event-Driven Communication System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create an event bus system that allows components to communicate through events, with support for synchronous and asynchronous event handling.
### Details:
1. Create src/agent_nexus/core/events.py module
2. Define Event base class and common event types
3. Implement EventBus class with publish/subscribe methods
4. Add support for event filtering and prioritization
5. Create decorators for event handlers
6. Implement both sync and async event processing
7. Add logging for event debugging
8. Write unit tests for event publishing and subscription
9. Test by creating sample events and verifying they're properly routed between components

## 6. Create Component Registry and Lifecycle Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Implement a registry system for components that handles initialization, dependency injection, and lifecycle management.
### Details:
1. Create src/agent_nexus/core/registry.py module
2. Implement ComponentRegistry class for registering and retrieving components
3. Add dependency resolution for components that depend on each other
4. Implement lifecycle hooks (init, start, stop) for components
5. Create factory functions for component instantiation based on configuration
6. Add validation to ensure required components are registered
7. Write unit tests for component registration and lifecycle management
8. Test by registering mock components and verifying proper initialization order

## 7. Setup Docker Configuration for Development and Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Create Docker configuration files for both development and production environments, including multi-stage builds and Docker Compose setup.

# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Short-term Memory System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the short-term memory component that maintains conversation context and immediate task information with configurable retention parameters.
# Details:
Create a memory class with methods for storing, retrieving, and managing conversation context. Implement priority-based information management for determining what information to keep. Add configurable retention parameters to control memory lifespan. Develop memory pruning mechanisms to prevent overflow. Include serialization/deserialization for persistence between sessions.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for memory operations (add, retrieve, update, delete). Performance tests for memory operations under load. Verification of priority-based retention with simulated conversations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ShortTermMemory Class Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core ShortTermMemory class with basic data structures and interfaces
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a ShortTermMemory class with appropriate data structures (e.g., queue, priority queue, or specialized container) to store conversation entries
2. Define memory entry data structure with fields for content, timestamp, priority, and metadata
3. Implement constructor with configurable parameters (max_size, default_retention_time)
4. Create basic interface methods: add_entry(), get_entries(), clear()
5. Add docstrings and type hints

Testing approach:
- Unit test the initialization with different parameters
- Test basic add and retrieve functionality
- Verify empty state handling

## 2. Implement Memory Retention and Pruning [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add time-based retention logic and memory pruning mechanisms
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Add timestamp tracking for each memory entry
2. Implement configurable retention parameters (time-based, count-based)
3. Create prune_old_entries() method to remove entries based on age
4. Add prune_by_count() method to limit total entries
5. Implement automatic pruning during add_entry() when thresholds are exceeded
6. Add memory usage statistics tracking

Testing approach:
- Test that old entries are correctly pruned based on time
- Verify count-based pruning works as expected
- Test edge cases (empty memory, all entries expired)
- Benchmark memory usage with different retention settings

## 3. Develop Priority-Based Information Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement priority scoring and importance-based retention logic
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design priority scoring system (numerical scale, e.g., 1-10)
2. Implement methods to assign priorities to memory entries
3. Create priority-based retrieval functionality (get_entries_by_priority())
4. Modify pruning logic to consider priority when removing entries
5. Add priority boosting for frequently accessed entries
6. Implement priority decay over time for less relevant information

Testing approach:
- Test that high-priority items are retained longer than low-priority ones
- Verify priority-based retrieval returns correct entries in proper order
- Test priority boosting and decay mechanisms
- Ensure pruning respects priority settings

## 4. Implement Context-Aware Memory Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.3
### Description: Add functionality to maintain and retrieve conversation context
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Implement conversation thread tracking with unique identifiers
2. Create methods to retrieve conversation history by thread
3. Add context window management (sliding window of recent conversation)
4. Implement relevance scoring for contextual retrieval
5. Add methods to extract key information from conversation context
6. Create summarization hooks for long conversations

Testing approach:
- Test conversation threading with multiple interleaved conversations
- Verify context window correctly maintains recent conversation
- Test relevance-based retrieval with sample conversations
- Ensure context is properly maintained across multiple interactions

## 5. Implement Memory Serialization and Persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Add functionality to save and load memory state between sessions
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design serialization format for memory entries (JSON, pickle, or custom format)
2. Implement save_to_file(path) and load_from_file(path) methods
3. Add memory state versioning for backward compatibility
4. Implement incremental saving to prevent data loss
5. Add encryption options for sensitive memory content
6. Create memory integrity validation during loading

Testing approach:
- Test serialization and deserialization with various memory states
- Verify data integrity after save/load cycles
- Test backward compatibility with different versions
- Check error handling for corrupted or invalid save files

## 6. Create Memory Query and Analysis Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Implement advanced query capabilities and memory analysis tools
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design query language or interface for complex memory searches
2. Implement search by content, metadata, time range, and priority
3. Add pattern matching and semantic similarity search capabilities
4. Create memory statistics and analytics methods
5. Implement memory visualization helpers (for debugging/monitoring)
6. Add hooks for external systems to query memory

Testing approach:
- Test complex queries with diverse memory content
- Verify search performance with large memory sets
- Test pattern matching with various input patterns
- Ensure statistics accurately reflect memory state
- Validate that all query types return expected results

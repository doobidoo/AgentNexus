# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement DocAnalysis and RAGRetrieval Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the DocAnalysis tool for document understanding and extraction, and RAGRetrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities.
# Details:
Create DocAnalysis tool with support for various document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.). Implement text extraction, structure recognition, and metadata parsing. Develop RAGRetrieval tool that combines vector search with text generation for knowledge-grounded responses. Integrate with the memory system for context-aware retrieval. Add document chunking and processing pipelines. Implement caching for improved performance.

# Test Strategy:
Test DocAnalysis with various document types and structures. Verify text extraction accuracy and metadata parsing. Test RAGRetrieval with different queries and knowledge bases. Measure relevance and quality of augmented generation.
